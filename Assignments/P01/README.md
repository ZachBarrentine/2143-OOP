## P01 - Fraction Class
### Zachary Barrentine
### Description:

The purpose of this program is to utilize a class to store inputted fractions from a data file and compare them with each other in many ways. Using operator overloading, the class allows for the user to add, subtract, divide, multiply, and determine equality between two fractions at a time. In order for this to occur, the least commom denominator as well as the least common multiple are determined.
