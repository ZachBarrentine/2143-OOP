## P02C - KnuckleBones
### Zach Barrentine
### Description:

The purpose of this project was to recreate the game KnuckleBones from Cult of the Lamb from the material provided. My professor made the basis for all of the files for this program, the goal was simply for me to edit and add to the code so that it created the game itself. This program was put to a halt so it is incomplete. This is a record of this incomplete project. I have changed various properties such as on and off color, the keys necessary for ending the program, as well as an attempt at altering the text itself.
